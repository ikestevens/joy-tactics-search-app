0:00:00 - 0:00:20::Welcome to Joy Tactics. The podcast dedicated to all things joyful, joyous and meeting as many celebrities as humanly possible.
0:00:20 - 0:00:26::Hosted by Eric Rahill, Nate Veroni and Jack Bensinger. Enjoy.
0:00:26 - 0:00:34::You're probably wondering if you're watching on YouTube right now. Well, there's not three screens.
0:00:34 - 0:00:40::Just two screens. Why is that? What's going on?
0:00:40 - 0:00:44::Did one of the members of Joy Tactics quit? Why is there only two?
0:00:44 - 0:00:50::They wish. Everybody wishes it was just two. No, y'all aren't going to get that.
0:00:50 - 0:00:58::We're having technical difficulties. Jack and I are deep into our world tour of the southeast.
0:00:58 - 0:01:04::It's not a world tour. It's in the world.
0:01:04 - 0:01:12::Yeah, I don't appreciate that from you, man. There's a reason we didn't ask your ass to come out here.
0:01:12 - 0:01:16::It's definitely not because we're already basically paying to do this tour.
0:01:16 - 0:01:24::We're not paying to do it, but we may end up owing money to the venue.
0:01:24 - 0:01:32::Well, this is, we're investing in ourselves because I'm flying club promoters out from all around the country to come, kind of vet us.
0:01:32 - 0:01:36::Plus security guards. Plus, they're security guards.
0:01:36 - 0:01:40::Oh, yeah, the security. You guys don't need security.
0:01:40 - 0:01:46::No, we don't. No, no, no, no, no, because we try not having security for a while in Brooklyn.
0:01:46 - 0:01:52::Because you know how they got Chris Red. That dude just back up.
0:01:52 - 0:01:56::I mean, no, I'm not saying who. I'm not saying who. That was a random active violence as far as I'm concerned.
0:01:56 - 0:02:04::But that dude, the, the somebody's basically outside of our shows going back and forth like a NPC outside of the fucking venue every single time.
0:02:04 - 0:02:12::But what I want to say is I don't want to discredit that there are people that out there that want to harm you.
0:02:12 - 0:02:20::I just think that you're letting these people that are security guards live with you.
0:02:20 - 0:02:28::And they're not paying rent. And it just seems like these people are just want a free housing because they don't coming out to the shows.
0:02:28 - 0:02:36::They're not really like doing their jobs as security guards for you. They're just kind of living for free on your couch.
0:02:36 - 0:02:44::And they're fun. Maybe that's what it looks like from the outside, but we pick the security guards that everybody else passed over.
0:02:44 - 0:02:52::We basically have hired the root, the rooties of security guards who are basically they look like jockeys. They're about 120 pounds.
0:02:52 - 0:02:56::Remember that movie Rudy, the underdog? No, but I met someone with that name once.
0:02:56 - 0:03:06::We basically hire the peaky blinders looking like little guys and what you don't know is they've got knives lining all under their shirts and pants.
0:03:06 - 0:03:10::That's right. So yeah, just try to come shake our hands and see if you don't get sliced.
0:03:10 - 0:03:16::Yeah, because guess what you're going to think you're going to beat them right. Oh, they're so small. I'm going to just go tackle them.
0:03:16 - 0:03:23::They're covered in knives had to tell us. So if you even touch them, you're going to get sliced out open like a pineapple on a barbecue set.
0:03:23 - 0:03:37::So Nate, does that change your perspective at all and help you understand a little bit where we're coming from when we say, yeah, dude, we're spending exorbitant amounts of money on thing on security guards who are four foot one British people.
0:03:37 - 0:03:51::Let's say right. Well, what what you're what you're saying with the knives and such knives out definitely does give me a little bit different of your perspective on what I had thought previously about this.
0:03:51 - 0:04:00::Kind of business decision you guys made. So yeah, I just need some time to think that shit. And we'll get you. And I know we're using your.
0:04:00 - 0:04:10::I knew it in your using yours yours chunk of the joy tactics Patreon money to pay for it. But it's all which I have no problem with.
0:04:10 - 0:04:24::We are so we're investing in ourselves is what you guys have convinced me. Self-visions. I haven't seen it kind of worked out in the way that we're growing in it, you know, because of this investment.
0:04:24 - 0:04:33::But a lot of the investments in yourself. You're not going to see for well a long time. It's so it's so funny right. When you learn from your classes.
0:04:33 - 0:04:44::When you tell someone you're doing something right, you're saying I'm going to try to do this. They're going to laugh at you after week one when you haven't become an all star and that thing that you chosen to do right right.
0:04:44 - 0:04:50::Six months down the road they're going to be looking at you. They're going to be laughing at you because you still haven't made it right.
0:04:50 - 0:04:55::The year down the road two years they're going to be laughing at you. I told you you couldn't do it.
0:04:55 - 0:05:00::But we think in decades not year not moments. You know I'm saying.

0:05:00 - 0:05:03.280000::So I'm laughing at them from the future because in three decades,
0:05:03.280000 - 0:05:06.120000::like, we'll be fucking laughing from the top of our money pile.
0:05:06.120000 - 0:05:07.640000::30 years is gonna take a lot of time.
0:05:07.640000 - 0:05:08.480000::30 years.
0:05:09.920000 - 0:05:11.600000::Oh, because this is by the way,
0:05:13 - 0:05:16.520000::I mean, I'm already laughing because 30 years is when we'll be at the bank,
0:05:16.520000 - 0:05:18.520000::but you know, when you laugh, right?
0:05:19.520000 - 0:05:22.240000::On the way to the bank, all the way to the bank.
0:05:22.240000 - 0:05:23::On the whole way to the bank.
0:05:23 - 0:05:24.720000::Laughing on the way to the bank.
0:05:24.720000 - 0:05:25.840000::That's what I'm doing right now.
0:05:25.840000 - 0:05:29.920000::You imagine getting in your car as a kid and your mom and dad are laughing
0:05:29.920000 - 0:05:30.920000::all the way to the bank.
0:05:30.920000 - 0:05:32.200000::That would be so disturbing.
0:05:32.200000 - 0:05:36.200000::Laughing on the other page.
0:05:36.200000 - 0:05:38.200000::Laughing on the other page.
0:05:38.200000 - 0:05:40.200000::Yeah, that would be disturbing.
0:05:40.200000 - 0:05:42.920000::But, nah, I can't fucking remember.
0:05:42.920000 - 0:05:47.400000::I'm having mental deterioration from traveling and touring so much.
0:05:47.400000 - 0:05:49.400000::We're just giving so much.
0:05:49.400000 - 0:05:50.400000::We're just giving so much.
0:05:50.400000 - 0:05:53.400000::I'm literally giving crazy amount to.
0:05:53.400000 - 0:05:55.400000::Literally two nights of shows.
0:05:56.400000 - 0:06:02.400000::It's just like I have so much respect for jelly roll and Taylor Swift.
0:06:02.400000 - 0:06:04.400000::Like there's schedules.
0:06:04.400000 - 0:06:05.400000::So crazy.
0:06:05.400000 - 0:06:06.400000::Yeah.
0:06:06.400000 - 0:06:07.400000::Yeah.
0:06:07.400000 - 0:06:11.400000::And yeah, maybe you know the little salt, salt stain right there for my sweat.
0:06:11.400000 - 0:06:15.400000::It's because I've been hitting the gym wearing my hat with the hat on.
0:06:15.400000 - 0:06:16.400000::Yeah.
0:06:16.400000 - 0:06:18.400000::And I got a haircut, Nate.
0:06:18.400000 - 0:06:20.400000::Nate, did you see the haircut?
0:06:20.400000 - 0:06:21.400000::You got a haircut.
0:06:21.400000 - 0:06:22.400000::Look at Jack.
0:06:22.400000 - 0:06:24.400000::Look how lined up he got.
0:06:24.400000 - 0:06:26.400000::No, I saw that's what I commented on.
0:06:26.400000 - 0:06:27.400000::Oh, yeah.
0:06:27.400000 - 0:06:32.400000::I thought he had the, like, it was like buzz cut, like on the top, but it was, you just kind
0:06:32.400000 - 0:06:36.960000::of had like a fucked up, like zoom background when I was first looking at it.
0:06:36.960000 - 0:06:39.400000::But I want to see the picture that I was good.
0:06:39.400000 - 0:06:42.400000::I want to see the picture that I gave the guy.
0:06:42.400000 - 0:06:45.400000::Oh, this is hilarious.
0:06:45.400000 - 0:06:46.400000::Oh, yeah.
0:06:46.400000 - 0:06:47.400000::Oh, you gave that.
0:06:47.400000 - 0:06:50.400000::Did you really show him that?
0:06:50.400000 - 0:06:51.400000::Yeah, I did.
0:06:51.400000 - 0:06:52.400000::Well, he did laugh.

0:06:53.400000 - 0:06:54.400000::He didn't laugh.
0:06:54.400000 - 0:06:57.400000::They were, they weren't.
0:06:57.400000 - 0:07:01.400000::This wasn't a safe place for somebody who's not a hipster.
0:07:01.400000 - 0:07:08.400000::I'm not a hipster, but somebody who cultured, cultured city wise.
0:07:08.400000 - 0:07:10.400000::This was basically this guy was 65 years old.
0:07:10.400000 - 0:07:13.400000::He'd been doing hair for 40 years.
0:07:13.400000 - 0:07:15.400000::Oh, that's a huge moment.
0:07:15.400000 - 0:07:16.400000::That's a huge moment.
0:07:16.400000 - 0:07:17.400000::Oh, that's a huge moment.
0:07:17.400000 - 0:07:18.400000::SIGARETS in there.
0:07:18.400000 - 0:07:19.400000::The old timing.
0:07:19.400000 - 0:07:23.120000::And they're in a Ricky Bobby shirt just like pacing back and forth all crazy, talking shit
0:07:23.120000 - 0:07:25.120000::about his girlfriend.
0:07:25.120000 - 0:07:28.760000::And this guy had the barber had a bug on the back of his neck, the whole cut.
0:07:28.760000 - 0:07:32.360000::So he kept going, damn, what's that on my neck every time he tried and do something.
0:07:32.360000 - 0:07:34.860000::And then…
0:07:34.860000 - 0:07:37.560000::But that's that's how you know they got the good cuts.
0:07:37.560000 - 0:07:39.200000::Because look at me now.
0:07:39.200000 - 0:07:40.760000::I'm getting paid per.

0:07:41.760000 - 0:07:47.360000::So come down if you ever in Raleigh, North Carolina, go wherever that place is.
0:07:47.360000 - 0:07:48.640000::If you want to get a line.
0:07:48.640000 - 0:07:49.640000::Nice.
0:07:49.640000 - 0:07:50.640000::Yeah.

0:07:52.640000 - 0:07:53.640000::This is crazy.
0:07:53.640000 - 0:07:54.640000::Yeah.
0:07:54.640000 - 0:07:57.040000::We've been hitting Southern food in such a crazy way.
0:07:57.040000 - 0:08:00.640000::First day, would we get chicken Caesar salads, diet cakes?
0:08:00.640000 - 0:08:02.640000::Would we have for lunch yesterday?
0:08:02.640000 - 0:08:03.640000::Indian food.
0:08:03.640000 - 0:08:10.680000::Yeah, you got to try the Sag Paneer and you get the 1 p.m. Sag Paneer eating challenge here
0:08:10.680000 - 0:08:11.680000::down here in Raleigh, North Carolina.
0:08:11.680000 - 0:08:13.680000::You can't get that New York.
0:08:13.680000 - 0:08:14.680000::No, sir.
0:08:14.680000 - 0:08:18.600000::So many guys are basically touring to a country.
0:08:18.600000 - 0:08:23.360000::And explore other cuisines outside of New York City.
0:08:23.360000 - 0:08:24.360000::And…
0:08:24.360000 - 0:08:25.360000::Yeah.
0:08:25.360000 - 0:08:28.520000::It's because when you get to the top of a…
0:08:28.520000 - 0:08:31.920000::Like right now, I'd say we're like at the top of the New York scene.
0:08:31.920000 - 0:08:33.080000::Like almost undoubtedly.
0:08:33.080000 - 0:08:34.080000::Yeah.
0:08:34.080000 - 0:08:36.280000::And when you get to the top, it's weirdly lonely.
0:08:36.280000 - 0:08:39.360000::Where it's like, that's where you always thought you wanted to be, right?
0:08:39.360000 - 0:08:40.360000::Well, guess what?
0:08:40.360000 - 0:08:41.360000::Right.
0:08:41.360000 - 0:08:44.360000::The girls are even afraid to go there because they're so scared of you and even the guys
0:08:44.360000 - 0:08:45.360000::too.
0:08:45.360000 - 0:08:46.360000::So when you're at the top, it's at a lonely out.
0:08:46.360000 - 0:08:49.080000::You have to feel bad for kings and queens.
0:08:49.080000 - 0:08:50.080000::Look at that now.
0:08:50.080000 - 0:08:52::So yeah, let's get out of our comfort zone a little bit.
0:08:52 - 0:08:53::We'll go be just…
0:08:53 - 0:08:57.760000::We'll go to the bottom because these places are the bottom, man.
0:08:57.760000 - 0:08:58.760000::There's no way around it.
0:08:58.760000 - 0:09:00.760000::I mean, I'm trying to have fun.
0:09:00.760000 - 0:09:01.760000::It's pathetic.
0:09:01.760000 - 0:09:02.760000::It's really…
0:09:02.760000 - 0:09:03.760000::I can't believe I made it out.
0:09:03.760000 - 0:09:05.800000::I'm surprised they let us get out.
0:09:05.800000 - 0:09:06.800000::It's really tough down here.
0:09:06.800000 - 0:09:10.720000::As soon as you get below the Mason Dixon line, it's literally like gravity is 10 times
0:09:10.720000 - 0:09:12.760000::stronger here somehow.
0:09:12.760000 - 0:09:16.480000::The food is 10 times harder to swallow somehow.
0:09:16.480000 - 0:09:17.480000::Life is not easy.
0:09:17.480000 - 0:09:18.480000::People are out here.
0:09:18.480000 - 0:09:20.480000::They talk about how New York City is crime-infected.
0:09:20.480000 - 0:09:21.480000::Uh-uh-uh.
0:09:21.480000 - 0:09:22.480000::Do you…
0:09:22.480000 - 0:09:24.160000::Have you guys seen those ads for those…
0:09:24.160000 - 0:09:28.480000::If you live alone like the choking suction cup?
0:09:28.480000 - 0:09:29.480000::Yeah, this thing…
0:09:29.480000 - 0:09:31.160000::And it sucks it out, you mouth.
0:09:31.160000 - 0:09:32.160000::What?
0:09:32.160000 - 0:09:33.160000::Yeah, I've seen that.
0:09:33.160000 - 0:09:34.160000::You can put like…
0:09:34.160000 - 0:09:38.400000::It looks like an oxygen mask kind of and like a tube and you like…
0:09:38.400000 - 0:09:42.320000::Get a lot of the air pressure in there and you suck the blocker out of your throat.
0:09:42.800000 - 0:09:43.800000::You have seen that.
0:09:43.800000 - 0:09:46.840000::It's if you ever are choking on a piece of food.
0:09:46.840000 - 0:09:48.840000::And you're alone and knowing they're doing the high point.
0:09:48.840000 - 0:09:51.520000::Knowing they're to suck out of your mouth for you with their mouth.
0:09:51.520000 - 0:09:52.880000::They have that for dogs too.
0:09:52.880000 - 0:09:54.680000::That's something my mom would buy.
0:09:54.680000 - 0:09:58.160000::Like, I know exactly…
0:09:58.160000 - 0:10:00.040000::That's probably selling like fucking hotcakes.

0:10:00 - 0:10:05.600000::dude. Oh dude especially in China where people more people are living low in
0:10:05.600000 - 0:10:12.120000::lifestyles than ever. Maybe that's Japan. I'm just constantly impressed and in
0:10:12.120000 - 0:10:21::all of your knowledge Chinese living standards. I have my finger on how they
0:10:21 - 0:10:31.880000::are. Yeah we got to go to it. I think we have before it all unfolds before Taiwan
0:10:31.880000 - 0:10:37.800000::becomes the most hottest war zone of all time between the East and the West. We
0:10:37.800000 - 0:10:42.840000::have to do joy tactics world China tour with fucking we're gonna get the

0:15:26.080000 - 0:15:27.520000::It's going to be much easier.
0:15:27.520000 - 0:15:30.880000::And then you'll still be able to go to Miami and kill it
0:15:30.880000 - 0:15:34.200000::on the dance floor and on the strip.

0:15:41.840000 - 0:15:42.760000::The breast reduction.
0:15:42.760000 - 0:15:45.640000::Are you that's a disrespectful to God?
0:15:45.640000 - 0:15:46.480000::All right.
0:15:46.480000 - 0:15:48.640000::You God gave you that.
0:15:48.640000 - 0:15:50.440000::All that milk.

0:16:06.480000 - 0:16:09.560000::We need to give all the blue collar comedy to our people,
0:16:09.560000 - 0:16:13.240000::just like the back pain that you would have if you, you know,
0:16:13.240000 - 0:16:14.040000::I know.
0:16:14.040000 - 0:16:15.360000::Just to give them an experience.
0:16:15.360000 - 0:16:16.880000::Just for a second.
0:16:16.880000 - 0:16:17.400000::Right.
0:16:17.400000 - 0:16:19.800000::You fucking massage in his fucking pigs.

0:16:22.040000 - 0:16:23.280000::I fucking hate what?
0:16:23.280000 - 0:16:24.680000::Dude, don't give me started.
0:16:24.680000 - 0:16:25.200000::Don't get it.

0:16:26.120000 - 0:16:26.960000::Let's move on.
0:16:26.960000 - 0:16:29.600000::Because if we go up on white trash, oh, dude,
0:16:29.600000 - 0:16:31.840000::we may lose a big portion of our audience,
0:16:31.840000 - 0:16:34.200000::but it's all worth it because it's how we feel.
0:16:34.200000 - 0:16:35.200000::We're taking half the trash.
0:16:35.200000 - 0:16:37.640000::It was so funny.
0:16:37.640000 - 0:16:38.640000::I don't think we told you this, Nate,
0:16:38.640000 - 0:16:40.120000::but like we were wondering, who's
0:16:40.120000 - 0:16:42.240000::going to come to these fucking shows out here?
0:16:42.240000 - 0:16:44.240000::And we're like, is it going to be regular people
0:16:44.240000 - 0:16:46.400000::on like Valentine's Day, dates?
0:16:46.400000 - 0:16:47.600000::We were hoping not.
0:16:47.600000 - 0:16:50.480000::And then immediately all of the joy tacticians show up.
0:16:50.480000 - 0:16:52.280000::And it's like, yep.
0:16:52.280000 - 0:16:52.800000::There they are.
0:16:52.800000 - 0:16:55.640000::They look basically just like us with beard,
0:16:55.640000 - 0:16:59::glasses, mostly.
0:16:59 - 0:17:04.120000::Well, that goes against our theory that all the people
0:17:04.120000 - 0:17:05.600000::that listen to this are like.
0:17:05.600000 - 0:17:10.360000::Cassandre, Portuguese, expats, and America.
0:17:10.360000 - 0:17:12::And they just don't have any sort of,
0:17:12 - 0:17:13.520000::they're busy, though, the funny part.
0:17:13.520000 - 0:17:15.800000::Yeah.
0:17:15.800000 - 0:17:18.080000::Providing them on a totally.
0:17:18.080000 - 0:17:19.080000::Yeah.
0:17:19.080000 - 0:17:20.080000::Yeah.
0:17:20.080000 - 0:17:20.880000::So that's interesting.
0:17:20.880000 - 0:17:22.640000::They look exactly like us.
0:17:22.640000 - 0:17:24.360000::That's who's listening to this.
0:17:24.360000 - 0:17:25.440000::That's what it seems like.
0:17:25.440000 - 0:17:26.960000::No, they don't look like me, man.
0:17:26.960000 - 0:17:28.920000::Was there any bald people in the crowd?
0:17:28.920000 - 0:17:30.360000::No.
0:17:30.360000 - 0:17:30.880000::I don't think that was one.
0:17:30.880000 - 0:17:32.920000::No, wait, there was one.
0:17:32.920000 - 0:17:33.920000::There was one.
0:17:33.920000 - 0:17:35.080000::Oh, yeah, there was one.
0:17:35.080000 - 0:17:35.600000::There was one.
0:17:35.600000 - 0:17:36.600000::There was at least one.
0:17:36.600000 - 0:17:37.200000::Oh, yeah.
0:17:37.200000 - 0:17:38.840000::I was rocking with one.
0:17:38.840000 - 0:17:39.800000::You didn't make fun of them.
0:17:39.800000 - 0:17:41.640000::Did you usually do?
0:17:41.640000 - 0:17:44.840000::No, do you have time to commit?
0:17:44.840000 - 0:17:46.120000::No, no, no.
0:17:46.120000 - 0:17:50.720000::All I did is I just kept seeing if I could spit my gum out.
0:17:50.720000 - 0:17:52.800000::And it would stick to their head, but that's it.
0:17:52.800000 - 0:17:55.280000::Whenever someone that's bald sees my hairline,
0:17:55.280000 - 0:17:58.240000::I can feel the heat of their fucking jealousy and rage.
0:17:58.240000 - 0:17:59.080000::Oh, my god.
0:17:59.080000 - 0:17:59.600000::I'm with you.

0:18:06.080000 - 0:18:10.320000::you know, why you're wondering why there's like a limit to our friendship.
0:18:10.320000 - 0:18:12.520000::You know, oh shit, you got the ancient dragon.
0:18:12.520000 - 0:18:14.360000::Oh, but you never have a hairline.
0:18:14.360000 - 0:18:16.840000::I got the mod to move with GDK.

0:18:31.520000 - 0:18:34.720000::Yeah, it's kind of like Russia, but it's like a,
0:18:35.840000 - 0:18:36.880000::kind of like a military experiment.
0:18:36.880000 - 0:18:38.840000::Oh, dude, I watched this anime show.
0:18:38.840000 - 0:18:43.840000::It was the number two show on, like, Max streaming service.
0:18:45.200000 - 0:18:47.960000::And it was some new anime show.
0:18:47.960000 - 0:18:50.200000::It was called like Ninja Something.
0:18:50.200000 - 0:18:53.960000::It was a brand new season one episode one of this show.
0:18:53.960000 - 0:18:57::And I was like, dude, maybe I can get on the ground floor
0:18:57 - 0:18:59.040000::of an incredible anime show.
0:19:00 - 0:19:01.400000::And was it amazing?
0:19:01.400000 - 0:19:02.240000::Yeah.
0:19:02.240000 - 0:19:05.640000::I forget what the fuck it was called.
0:19:05.640000 - 0:19:10::It was so, it was like, it was so like,
0:19:10 - 0:19:14.600000::gory and that like, it was just like immediately like,
0:19:14.600000 - 0:19:18.280000::it's just like slicing off like hundreds of dudes heads
0:19:18.280000 - 0:19:20.640000::and like just ripping off their faces.
0:19:20.640000 - 0:19:22.120000::I was like, this is amazing.
0:19:22.120000 - 0:19:23.240000::I'm talking about, man.

0:19:25.920000 - 0:19:30.920000::I wouldn't, it was like, it was corny, you know what I'm saying?
0:19:31.640000 - 0:19:35.360000::And I know a lot of the animation community is probably,

0:21:38.400000 - 0:21:42.160000::I tried to nuke pedophiles Epstein Island years and years
0:21:42.160000 - 0:21:44.400000::before anybody even knew what he was up to.
0:21:44.400000 - 0:21:46::And now I tried to get me and Chubbos.
0:21:46 - 0:21:46.960000::And here's the coordinates.
0:21:46.960000 - 0:21:50.080000::I got him trying to build a nuke pretty much
0:21:50.080000 - 0:21:50.920000::since I was born.
0:21:50.920000 - 0:21:52.960000::I'm trying to fucking figure out how to support that.
0:21:52.960000 - 0:21:55.480000::Why don't they have precision nukes that just killed?
0:21:55.480000 - 0:21:58.680000::They just eviscerate one single person.
0:21:58.680000 - 0:22:02.320000::Because that's the tiny nukes that's like a basically a double.
0:22:02.320000 - 0:22:06.720000::Don't you think one person could have a nuclear weapon?
0:22:06.720000 - 0:22:10.720000::Like one single person, they tried really hard
0:22:10.720000 - 0:22:14.200000::and kind of knew the plutonium people.
0:22:14.200000 - 0:22:17.080000::Yeah, they can get all the sort of nugget of plutonium,
0:22:17.080000 - 0:22:19.760000::make one single nuclear weapon.
0:22:19.760000 - 0:22:21.440000::You be out.
0:22:21.440000 - 0:22:22.920000::Don't you think, should we do it?

0:22:23.440000 - 0:22:25.440000::There are plutonium watch dogs out there.
0:22:25.440000 - 0:22:27.480000::I mean, we should bro, we did it.
0:22:27.480000 - 0:22:29.920000::The joy tactics nuke, they'd have to respect us.
0:22:29.920000 - 0:22:31.720000::They'd have to let us get whatever the fuck we want.
0:22:31.720000 - 0:22:33.520000::If we really had a nuke and we're
0:22:33.520000 - 0:22:35.240000::to say we're not going to tell you where it is, man,
0:22:35.240000 - 0:22:37.200000::but we got it and it's ready to go.

0:22:39.400000 - 0:22:40.600000::Exactly.
0:22:40.600000 - 0:22:42.120000::It's like glowing, glowing.
0:22:42.120000 - 0:22:45.480000::Like there's two more children's grown at your fucking face.
0:22:45.480000 - 0:22:47.040000::It's really like killing you back.
0:22:47.040000 - 0:22:49::I get the edge of death.
0:22:49 - 0:22:50.320000::Nate's got it in his pants.
0:22:50.320000 - 0:22:51.840000::I'm not going to tell you where it is.
0:22:51.840000 - 0:22:52.960000::You'll never know.
0:22:52.960000 - 0:22:54.160000::Now, but you're going to find it.
0:22:54.160000 - 0:22:57.080000::We're wheeling Nate around on like a crazy crazy ass.
0:23:01.960000 - 0:23:03.680000::The joy tactics nuke.
0:23:03.680000 - 0:23:06.120000::If anybody could hook us up, we got any chemists out there.
0:23:06.120000 - 0:23:07.040000::Is that what that would be?
0:23:07.040000 - 0:23:07.880000::Yeah, chemists.
0:23:07.880000 - 0:23:09::Is this any chemists out there?
0:23:09 - 0:23:10.800000::There's no one.
0:23:10.800000 - 0:23:13::I would say a lot of people would ask for millions of dollars.
0:23:13 - 0:23:16.120000::I would ask the government to end world hunger.
0:23:16.120000 - 0:23:17.120000::What?
0:23:17.120000 - 0:23:18.240000::That's my demand.

0:30:16.080000 - 0:30:20.240000::canceled essentially is because they're frustrated that they can't just
0:30:20.240000 - 0:30:25.480000::fast as us they can't hop from leapfrog to leapfrog right topic to topic because
0:30:25.480000 - 0:30:29.040000::you might come at me what's funny is we might have a discussion about three
0:30:29.040000 - 0:30:33.600000::different topics at the same time where I'm saying Nate I think that's

0:33:41.880000 - 0:33:46.520000::understanding of the sexual organisms of fish which I know you would expect me
0:33:46.520000 - 0:33:51.480000::to know a little bit more about that but in my head you're being bashful in

0:34:54.040000 - 0:34:59.800000::think this is the way it works is the female fish goes to the bottom of the ocean

0:35:00 - 0:35:03.500000::and lays a bunch of little tiny eggs, right?
0:35:03.500000 - 0:35:06.380000::They put bump on some algae in, yeah.
0:35:06.380000 - 0:35:07.980000::Yeah, they just put them in here.
0:35:07.980000 - 0:35:11.380000::Shoot them out and then they shoot the eggs down in the,
0:35:11.380000 - 0:35:14.680000::and then the males kind of like either with sonar technology
0:35:14.680000 - 0:35:17.880000::or with smelling, they can smell the eggs,
0:35:17.880000 - 0:35:19.380000::the specific eggs that they want to,
0:35:19.380000 - 0:35:22.160000::they go down to the eggs and they start kind of jacking it
0:35:22.160000 - 0:35:24.560000::onto the eggs and the bottom of the ocean.
0:35:24.560000 - 0:35:26.520000::Oh, that's how we do it.
0:35:26.520000 - 0:35:29.200000::I know, but like do you think that is like?
0:35:29.200000 - 0:35:32.560000::That's like, they get worn up looking at.
0:35:32.560000 - 0:35:34.960000::Do you think that's like, yeah, yeah, there's no touching?
0:35:34.960000 - 0:35:38.560000::You wonder why there's no STIs in the ocean, right?
0:35:38.560000 - 0:35:41.240000::Why that's just a human and animalistic thing,
0:35:41.240000 - 0:35:44.200000::mammalistic thing.
0:35:44.200000 - 0:35:45.400000::Right.
0:35:45.400000 - 0:35:46.720000::But I don't know.
0:35:46.720000 - 0:35:49.520000::Do you think that fish are just like really like, wow,
0:35:49.520000 - 0:35:52.920000::like, they see that egg when they're fucking swimming
0:35:52.920000 - 0:35:53.440000::through the ocean?
0:35:53.440000 - 0:35:55.680000::They say, oh shit, they're in the group of eggs.
0:35:55.680000 - 0:35:56.280000::I gotta go.
0:35:56.280000 - 0:35:57.280000::That sounds like some of my-
0:35:57.280000 - 0:36:00.360000::Those eggs too, all orange and translucent,
0:36:00.360000 - 0:36:02.400000::finding the most out, sushi style.
0:36:04.600000 - 0:36:05.440000::Maybe they sell it.
0:36:05.440000 - 0:36:06.280000::I get it.
0:36:08.280000 - 0:36:10.120000::That turns them on, right?
0:36:10.120000 - 0:36:11.840000::I'm sure it does.
0:36:11.840000 - 0:36:12.840000::You don't want to be around anymore.
0:36:12.840000 - 0:36:14.480000::That's the way fish do it.
0:36:14.480000 - 0:36:15.960000::Are they doing it with their friends?
0:36:15.960000 - 0:36:18.080000::Or is it like a bunch of guys going out
0:36:18.080000 - 0:36:18.920000::and getting fucked up?
0:36:18.920000 - 0:36:20.120000::Oh, it's a fucking book of golf.
0:36:20.120000 - 0:36:21.600000::Fish, cock, fish.
0:36:21.600000 - 0:36:22.840000::Wait, what do you think?
0:36:22.840000 - 0:36:23.960000::Well, let me just pose this.

0:36:29.440000 - 0:36:31.480000::Do you not think that it's possible
0:36:31.480000 - 0:36:34.840000::that the ladies are planting their eggs
0:36:34.840000 - 0:36:40.320000::near things that turn fish on that we don't know about, right?
0:36:40.520000 - 0:36:43.600000::So they go, oh shit, there's this statue underwater
0:36:43.600000 - 0:36:46.920000::that's been carved out by exactly the fedassinoid
0:36:46.920000 - 0:36:50::underwater aquatic rocks that the fish are going
0:36:50 - 0:36:53.520000::and jerking off to and the ladies put their eggs right next
0:36:53.520000 - 0:36:56.080000::to it knowing that they're going to miss.
0:36:56.080000 - 0:36:58.320000::Because by the way, it's a lot of sense.

0:37:06.960000 - 0:37:08.400000::too disturbing for me.
0:37:08.400000 - 0:37:10.120000::Like, I'm out.
0:37:10.120000 - 0:37:11.120000::I'm tapping my eyes.

0:37:19 - 0:37:21.240000::have some of the most disturbing triggers.
0:37:21.240000 - 0:37:22::Yeah.
0:37:22 - 0:37:23::And I don't want to say that.
0:37:23.160000 - 0:37:24.160000::You wouldn't want to make it.
